# Efficient-Virtual-Machine-Placement-using-RL

The project emulates a data center and aims to use Deep Reinforcement Learning for the placement of virtual machines and their computational resources (i.e. CPU, Memory, Disk space, network and lifetime) while taking into consideration the power consumption of the placement. The reward structure is primarily focused on an efficient placement of Virtual Machines while keeping the energy consumption to a minimum. The algorithm used for the training is DQN (Deep Q Networks).
